        <li>Why would a developeruse local storage for a web application?</li>
        <p>Local storage can be used to collect and store user data for future use when the user visits the website. For development purposes, it can be used for testing.</p>
        <li>What information should not be stored in local storage?</li>
        <p>Nothing too personal should be stored in local storage. For example, someoneâ€™s name can be stored in local storage. However information like their address, password,  or credit card information should not be stored in local storage.</p>
        <li>Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?</li>
        <p>Local storage can only work with strings. You can convert any object into a string data type using JSON.stringify(). </p>
