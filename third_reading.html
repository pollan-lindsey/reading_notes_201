    <h3>Three examples of html lists</h3>

        </li>
        <li>
            Finish the list with a closing ul tag.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <li>
            A box model is something you use to format the webpage. It dictates how tall and wide everything is,
            and where it goes on the page. Everything on the webpage is in the box model.
        </li>
        <li>
            A box model is made up of a margin, a border, and padding, 
            all of which surround the content of the page.
        </li>
        <li>
            The two ways to display an element are block and inline
        </li>
        <li>
           By choosing to display the element in a block, the programmer is giving the element a rectangular space
           in which to be displayed. Nothing else can go in this rectangular space.
           An inline element is always displayed right next to the element before it, 
           regardless of any previously specified dimensions.  
        </li>
        <li>
            Some units of measurement are pixels (px), em, ex, ch, rem, and many more. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Javascript</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A condition that must be met using a statement of some kind usually containing comparison operators.
        </li>
        <li>
            You write a conditional by setting a condition and then writing the appropriate statement
            based on the condition you want to test.
        </li>
        <h3>Three examples of comparison operators</h3>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    === (strict equal to)
                </li>
                <li>
                    > (greater than)
                </li>
                <li>
                   <= (less than or equal to)  
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            A break keyword in javascript is br put inside tags. It is used to break out of a statement 
            the programmer wants to end.
        </li>
